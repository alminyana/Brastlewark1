## Development server

## Summary

### Technologies

Angular CLI: 7.3.10 | 
Node: 10.16.3 | 
OS: linux x64 | 
Angular: 7.2.16

The main branch with all the changes is 'master' which is a copy of 'develop' branch.

I have tryed to achieve all technical requirements except to cache the image url because I am out of time.
I didn't have experience working with Redux at my job position, so I implemented a basic structure of Redux in the app, passing the new state to store with Actions and Reducers and subscribing the component to the store in order to show the data.
I faced several errors in Unit test when I added store service to components or services, some of them aren't solved because i didn't have much time.
